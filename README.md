# Khontat-project
A contact application that helps users manage their contacts. It stores and organizes contact information, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, bithdays, and physical addresses, in a digital format. It may be upgraded in the future to allow users to add additional details about their contacts, such as job titles and social media profiles.
